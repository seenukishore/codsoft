# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview

This project involves building a predictive model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. By analyzing a dataset containing information about credit card transactions, the model helps distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent activities. Logistic Regression was employed to develop this classification model.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes features related to credit card transactions, such as:

- **Transaction Amount**: The amount of money involved in the transaction.
- **Transaction Date/Time**: The timestamp of the transaction.
- **Customer Information**: Account details, location, etc.
- **Transaction Details**: Merchant type, transaction type, etc.

This dataset can be sourced from a financial institution's database or publicly available datasets, such as the [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).

## Modeling Techniques

### 1. Data Preprocessing

- Handling imbalanced data using techniques like undersampling, oversampling, or SMOTE.
- Scaling numerical features.
- Encoding categorical variables.

### 2. Feature Selection

- Identifying key features that contribute to distinguishing between fraudulent and legitimate transactions.

### 3. Classification Algorithm

- **Logistic Regression**: A statistical model that predicts the probability of a binary outcome (fraud or no fraud) based on the transaction data. Logistic Regression was chosen for its interpretability and efficiency in binary classification tasks.

## Evaluation

The model was evaluated using several key metrics:

- **Accuracy**: The overall correctness of the model in classifying transactions.
- **Precision**: The proportion of correctly identified fraudulent transactions out of all transactions predicted as fraudulent.
- **Recall**: The proportion of actual fraudulent transactions that were correctly identified by the model.
- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of the model's performance.

Cross-validation was utilized to ensure the model's robustness and to fine-tune hyperparameters.

## Results

The Logistic Regression model achieved the following results:
